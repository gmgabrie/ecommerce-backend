  ## Description
  This is the backend for an ecommerce site.  A working Express.js API was added onto in order to use Sequelize to connect with a mySQL database.  The database consists of product categories, products, and product tags.  This backend is set up to accept various operations including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to categories, products and tags.  This are demonstrated in the walkthrough video below.

  ## Installation
  The Github repository for this application can be cloned locally and then the application can be ran from the Terminal using 'npm start' from the application directory.  To test interactions with the mySQL database you can use an application such as Insomnia to run test as shown in the walkthrough video.  You will need to have a code editor such as VS Code as well as mySQL.

  ## Usage
  Refer to walkthrough video below for examples of how create and seed the MySQL database, and use Insomnia to test GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests.
